## All The World's A Stage-Part 3


### Theatre in the Performing Arts Center

President Hartung joined the university in 1965 and attended the fall production of *Oklahoma!* directed by Jean Collette with Edmund Chavez as technical director/set designer and Charlie Walton as music director.

According to legend, after the impressive performance Hartung went backstage to congratulate the company and discovered that there was not much of a backstage to visit. He saw they worked with very little rigging and theatrical lights. He exclaimed: "You need a theatre!"

 One year later a fundraising campaign had begun for the Performing Arts Center. The *Argonaut* wrote that the fall show was the start of the campaign. “It all began when I saw *Oklahoma!*" said Dr. Hartung in an interview ..." I was very impressed not only with that, but with Mrs McIver’s dance groups and the symphony orchestra. But the Ad Building auditorium lacked something acoustically.”

The Performing Arts Center was later renamed the Hartung Theater to honor the president's dedication to the arts. Since 1974, the Hartung has served as the university's main stage for theatrical productions. DancersDrummersDreamers is also seen there along with visiting groups. 

Most recently, the stage became the Bill Fagerbakke Stage for the actor, alumnus, and generous theatre donor. His most recent gift made it possible to replace the house seats.

### Theatre in the Pocket Playhouse

When the U-Hut came down in 2000, the Theatre Department's offices were moved to the renovated Shoup Hall dormitory. Shoup was repurposed as offices for several campus organizations. Theatre occupied two floors and the basement. On the first floor where a communal living area used to be the Pocket Playhouse was created. Inspired by the Jean Collette Theatre, this was a laboratory for students to try out new works or stage shows with minimal tech.
