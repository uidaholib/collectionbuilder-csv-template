## About The Blot Archive

The [Blot Magazine](https://www.blotmagazine.com/) began in 1946 as a part of the UI Student Media Department, alongside [The Argonaut newspaper](https://www.uiargonaut.com/) and the [Gem of the Mountains yearbook](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/gem/). Previously the campus humor and literary magazine, Blot was discontinued during the 1950s due to a lack of funds. After a long hiatus, Blot resumed production in 2004. Blot is presently a quarterly publication, completely produced from start to finish, by University of Idaho students. The magazine publishes a variety of writing, hoping to provide a contemporary perspective on UI students and their experiences.

This digital collection currently contains 46 issues from 2010 to 2021. We hope to digitize the earlier issues that are currently held in the U of I Special Collections.
