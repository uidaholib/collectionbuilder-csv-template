## About the Collection

This collection consists of black and white negatives from PG 101, the Gem of the Mountains Yearbook Photograph Collection (1948-1967). *The Gem of the Mountains* was the official yearbook of the University of Idaho from 1903 to 2004. Featured photos in this digital collection depict U of I campus life and events including past Homecoming parades, graduations, field trips, football games, performances and glimpses inside various classrooms and campus buildings. 

Over 100 volumes of *The Gem of the Mountains* have been digitized for online viewing. To view these yearbooks and for more information about the publication, please see [the University of Idaho Library's Gem of the Mountains Digital Yearbook Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/gem/index.html).

**This digital collection is in the process of being digitized. Only a limited set of the boxes are contained in this collection.**
