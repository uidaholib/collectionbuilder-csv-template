## About Washington, Idaho & Montana Railway Company

A group of Midwestern logging men formed the Wisconsin Log and Lumber Company to begin logging in the Potlach Basin of Idaho around 1900. In 1903, the company merged with Weyerhaeuser interests to form the Potlatch Lumber Company. After abandoning their first mill in Palouse, Washington, the company decided to build eighteen miles away from Moscow, and the town of Potlatch was built. 

The Washington, Idaho & Montana (WI&M) Railway Company was created after the Northern Pacific Railroad declined to build a road for the Potlatch Lumber Company. William E. Borah, then a lawyer, assisted setting up the incorporation of the railway company. The construction of the railway began in 1905, by the end of 1906, the line had reached Bovill, and in 1908, the line had reached Purdue. Original plans called for a further reach eastern through Clearwater county and across the Bitterroots into Montana, but the Milwaukee Road had built a line from St. Maries to Elk River in Clearwater County which connected with the WI&M at Bovill. Another possible reason in the change in plans into Montana could have been the 1910 forest fire [link].

The Milwaukee Road reached an agreement with Weyerhaeuser to not sell the now finished railway for ten years, but other interest in the railway led the Northern Pacific Railroad to return with renewed interest.

In 1922, the Northern Pacific agreed to joint freight rates with the WI&M.

In 1932, the holding company for the WI&M, the Inland Improvement Company, dissolved and the railway became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Potlatch Lumber Company.
