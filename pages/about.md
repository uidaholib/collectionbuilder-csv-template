On April 4, 2023, Earl Bennett donated his collection of 1,500 historic Idaho mining stock certificates to U of I Library Special Collections and Archives. Bennett, a former University of Idaho professor, is a scripophile, or someone who collects bond and share certificates. While this specialty may not be widely known, the historic value of the material collected is insurmountable.These stock certificates not only highlight the history of mining in Idaho, but they also bring this expansive history to a ground level. The certificates themselves are full of historic detail. They contain the names of people, companies, dates, locations, and even bank information. Not to mention the designs on the certificates are works of art. The intention is to create a digital collection from these materials. Digitizing this integral part of Idaho history is one of the many ways we can preserve the past. Stay tuned for more news on the progress!

Stock certificates are physical documents issued by companies to indicate ownership. Usually, the document will include the number of shares owned by the holder of the certificate, the purchase date, a corporate seal, and signatures. The collection assembled by Earl Bennett is particularly focused on certificates issued by mining companies in Idaho, though also has certificates from other industries and states.

The donor, Earl Bennett, was Dean of the College of Mines and Earth Resources and the College of Science at U of Idaho. He also served as the State Geologist for Idaho for many years. He served in the U.S. Airforce, attended University of Delaware for a B.A., N.C. State at Raleigh for a M.S., and University of Idaho for a PhD. His professional work led him to develop a deep interest in the history of the Coeur d'Alene Mining District. His expertise in the subject was recognized throughout the state and region.
