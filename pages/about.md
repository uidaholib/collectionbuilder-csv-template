## About History of Theatre at the U of I

Play production on the U of I Moscow campus was originally student body efforts and/or shows produced by the English Department. The first known production was "The Rivals" in 1900 directed by elocution instructor, [Aurelia Henry Reinhardt](https://harvester.lib.uidaho.edu/posts/2023/02/27/aurelia-henry-reinhardt.html). In 1954, department head Jean Collette and faculty member Ed Chavez started UI Summer Theatre. In the 1980s, it became known as Idaho Repertory Theatre (IRT). IRT was shuttered in 2016 and then returned to production in 2022.

This digital collection contains articles about U of I Theatre which is still creating and producing theatrical productions and educating students whether or not they are majors.
