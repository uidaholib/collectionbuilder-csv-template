## About The Blot Archive

Began in 1946, [Blot Magazine](https://www.blotmagazine.com/) was a part of the UI Student Media Department, alongside [The Argonaut newspaper](https://www.uiargonaut.com/) and the [Gem of the Mountains yearbook](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/gem/). Blot was previously the campus humor and literary magazine, but was discontinued during the 1950s due to a lack of funds. After a long hiatus, Blot resumed production in 2004. Blot is presently a quarterly publication, completely produced from start to finish, by University of Idaho students. The magazine publishes a variety of writing, hoping to provide a contemporary perspective on UI students and their experiences.

This digital collection currently contains 46 issues from 2010 to 2021. We hope to digitize the earlier issues that are currently held in the UI Special Collections.
