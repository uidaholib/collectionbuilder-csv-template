## About the National Oldtime Fiddle Contest and Festival
### Written by Daniel Olortegui Vargas


The violin is a well-known instrument. However, the fiddler musical instrument is not too well known. Believe it or not, they are synonymous; a fiddler is a violin, a bowed string musical instrument. Nevertheless, the fiddler is used more colloquially. The style of music makes a difference in determining when the word Fiddler or violin is used. The Fiddler is steeped in many popular traditions. One of the renowned and influential fiddler traditions is in Weiser, Idaho. This city is located in the rural western part of Idaho. Its sits at the confluence of the river that bears the same name and the great Snake River. Currently, the population is a little over 5,000 inhabitants. All these factors combine to start one of the most important fiddler contests. Weiser and Fiddler have crossed paths for over a century. In 1863, the Logans established a way station and covered wagon at Weiser. This conjuncture made many emigrants use Weiser to rest from a long journeys. Since that time, the Fiddler has been present in the region. In fact, there are reports of fiddler contests in Weiser dating back to 1914.

Perhaps the architect of the Fiddler we know today in Weiser is Blaine Stubblefield. He was the Idaho Chamber of Commerce Secretary from 1948 until he died in 1960. From Wallowa Valley, Oregon, Blaine hounded Chamber Directors to allocate $175 for a fiddler contest. It was not until 1953 that Blaine proposed the idea to hold the contest during the Fifth Annual Weiser Square Dance Festival intermissions. This event was held on April 18, 1953, and was called the Northwest Mountain Fiddler's Contest. Two people took that first-year prize money, and Dad Roberts won the first National Grand Champion. The event was a complete success. Northwest Mountain Fiddler's Contest was the name that was known until 1956. In 1956 the name was changed to Northwest Oldtime Fiddling Championship. At this time, the Treasure Valley Fiddler added a regional division. In 1959 the Junior Division was added under 18. In 1960 the Senior Division was added.

In 1963 the Northwest Oldtime Fiddlers Championship was renamed the National Oldtime Fiddlers Contest, the name we know today. In that same year, the Ladies division was added. In 1972 the Junior-Junior division was added so pre-teens would not have to compete with teenagers. In 1979 the Men's Division was added over 18. In 1983 the Small Fry Division was added under 9. In 1991, two more divisions were added, Adult and Senior-Senior. The contest is at Weiser high school, home of the Wolverines. The high school goes fiddler wild every year during the third week of June. Fiddlers and other musicians from about every state nationwide and abroad attend the event. Inside the high school, musicians in cowboy boots and straw hats practice and compete. The school is crowded and bristling, filled with sounds of dozens of musicians playing and practicing simultaneously in every key on a fiddle finger-board. Outside the quiet room where the actual competition is held is a strange jumble of notes with a strident Western flavor.

Once the patrons and contestants enter the event venue, contest registration is the first station. In 2023, the person in charge of this station was Jamie Hill. This station is critical since the contestants check in if they registered online before the contest or register if they still need it. In this place, the person in charge gives the contestants a name tag to give them access to all events. Inside, the contestants gather in the high school cafeteria, known as the practice room. This place is where the magic begins. At the same time, fiddlers practice their presentations that they will later play in front of the public and judges. This room has a great history behind it. It has witnessed the beginnings of many legends who have attended the event since they were little. Many fell in love with the fiddler in this room, watching the contestants practice or having one of the contestants give them their first fiddler lesson. All of that took place in this place.

That is one of many fascinating things about this place. We leave to the imagination how the contestants listen to themselves because, in this room, everyone plays simultaneously. However, in some almost mystical way, the fiddlers listen to each other and bring out magical melodies that captivate the audience. The contestants practice in this room but also look forward to being called to present their three songs. Frank and Julie Eisenhauer oversee this phase. Each participant has a number; Frank and Julie are in charge of ensuring that the fiddler goes on stage and that the one that follows gets ready so that everything flows as quickly and orderly as possible. It is important to mention that the Eisenhauer's has been linked to this contest for 56 years.

After going through Jamie Hill and the Eisenhauer, the contestants show what they are made of. They show the result of months and even years of preparation for the public to enjoy and to achieve the best score among the judges. The fiddlers enter the stage and play their three tunes. One of the tunes must be a hoedown, one must be a waltz, and the other is a “tune of choice” (something different than a waltz or hoedown). A strict time limit depends on the division and the round number. Contestants are classified into different age groups, and judging is based on danceability, old-time style, rhythm, and tone. If contestants win the first round, they move on to the subsequent rounds or playoffs. Contestants at Weiser are divided into seven age divisions and an open division. The Grand Champion Division is open to all ages, and the final five play five rounds and fifteen tunes unless a tie results in the final round.

Before a division competition starts, the judges play to show why they are judges. In 2023 there were four judges, John Francis, Danita Rast, Luke Bulla, and Mia Orosco-Kelso. The requirement to be a judge in this competition is to have won the National Grand Champion. However, it was not always like this; for example, in 1985, there were seven judges, of which only two were Grand National Champions, Tony Ludiker and Mark O'Connor. The same thing happened in 1984; of the six judges, only two were Grand Champions, Dick Barrett and Herman Johnson.

At the same time as the contestants' participation, the judges carefully listen to each performance to issue the deserved score. To give the best score without bias, the judges assemble on the floor below the stage in a room with only them and some speakers. The contest organizes all this arrangement so the judges do not look at who is playing and only listen to the tunes. The judges have their computers and put their scores there after the contestants play. After the judges issue the scores, someone from the staff who is sitting next to the judges takes a piece of paper and writes the number of the contestant, the round, the date, the division, the score of the three tunes, and the name of the judge who gave that score. Once this paper is done, it goes to the office next door.

In this office, there are always two people. The first lady with the first adding machine tabulates all the papers' scores. Then she gives it to the second adding machine. The second lady checks if all the numbers are correct. After all this process, other staff come and take the papers, double check the documents with the computer to see if the numbers are the same. After that, they input them in the scoring so everyone can know the score of all the contestants. Fun is not only found in high school. Outside the high school is the campground, which fills up with RVs and tents throughout the week of the festival. If someone wants to enjoy this festival fully, they must stay in the high school campground. There you will hear fiddling from dawn until past midnight. It is a truly wonderful experience.
