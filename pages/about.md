## About The Blot Archive

The [Blot Magazine](https://www.blotmagazine.com/) began in 1946 as a part of the [University of Idaho Student Media Department](https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/student-involvement/student-media), alongside [The Argonaut newspaper](https://www.uiargonaut.com/) and the [Gem of the Mountains yearbook](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/gem/). Originally the campus humor and literary magazine, Blot was discontinued during the 1950s due to a lack of funds. After a long hiatus, Blot resumed production in 2004. Blot is presently a quarterly publication, completely produced from start to finish, by University of Idaho students. The magazine publishes a variety of writing, hoping to provide a contemporary perspective on U of I students and their experiences.

This digital collection currently contains 21 issues from 1946 to 1951 and 64 issues from 2005 to 2021. 
The PDFs starting from 2010 were created by Blot staff and originally published on ISSUU to provide digital access in addition to their print magazine.
