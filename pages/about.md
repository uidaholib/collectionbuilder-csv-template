## About the McClure Center Archive

This digital collection brings together the publications of the University of Idaho’s [James A. and Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research](https://www.uidaho.edu/president/direct-reports/mcclure-center).
These items are generally published on the Center's website.
The PDFs are transferred to the University of Idaho Library for preservation and long term access.

The University of Idaho’s [James A. and Louise McClure Center for Public Policy Research](https://www.uidaho.edu/president/direct-reports/mcclure-center) was launched in 2007 and has become Idaho's most trusted and preeminent public policy research entity. A champion for state water rights and a nationally recognized leader in energy and natural resource policy, Senator McClure earned the respect of his colleagues for his thoughtful pursuit and promotion of bipartisan collaboration leading to the enactment and execution of sound public policy. The McClure Center’s collaborative and interdisciplinary approach to addressing society’s complex challenges sustains Senator and Louise McClure’s remarkable legacy.

The McClure Center conducts and publishes research on public policy and public affairs issues that impact the state, the region and the nation. Public policy is only as effective as the information, research and analysis upon which it is based. The McClure Center’s goal is to be a credible source for such research and analysis.
